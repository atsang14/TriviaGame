TRIVIA GAME

This is a basic Trivia Game where users try to guess the correct answer by the given time. After the 

user has guessed or the time has run out, the game will indicate whether or not the user has guessed 

correctly, incorrectly, or has ran out of time and a gif will pop up to correspond. After the user 

has completed the game, a score sheet will pop up indicating how many questions the user got 

correct, incorrect, or unaswered. The questions and answers are taken from a Trivia Game API.
